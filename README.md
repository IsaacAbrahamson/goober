This project was originally a simple Mongoose and Node API made in a course I took by Stephen Grider. I then added more routes and features and built a completely functional SPA in vanilla JavaScript to work with it. I also created a custom script to seed the database with realistic drivers to give the app a genuine feel. The only thing missing is authentication, and of course, real drivers.
